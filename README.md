Project 2: FLIGHT DATA ANALYSIS.
LINK TO ASSIGNMENT ON GITHUB :

PROJECT OBJECTIVES
 Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the “Airlines and their flight destinations”

TOOLS USED
 Microsoft excel (For data cleaning), Power BI (For visualizations) and MYSQL (For insights).
I used the textbox to highlight the title of the project (Airline Flights Analysis). I used slicers for airline name, origin city and day to enable an interactive dashboard. I used cards to visualize the average distance covered by all airlines, counts of origin city, origin state and number of airlines.
VISUALIZATIONS 
I used tools like clustered column charts, line charts, stacked bar charts to visualize some analysis like sum of departure delay using airlines names, sum of arrivals by airline name, count of flights id using days,  sum of distances flown by airlines and count of flights using airline name etc.
STEPS IN CLEANING AND ANALYZING THE DATA
In this analysis, I cleaned a dataset that was given. Here are the steps followed.
1.	I downloaded the data set from google sheet to an excel workbook.
2.	I copied and pasted on a new excel workbook to be able to format the cells to have a unique row height.
3.	I removed the duplicates.
4.	I changed some headers to have same uppercase
5.	I filled in the blanks in the columns with 0.
6.	I created a database on MYSQL. I uploaded my tables to MYSQL and set the schema to default. 
7.	I went on to answer some questions like; What are the names of the airlines in the data set?, How many airlines area in the data set?, What other destination cities did the airline named "Hawaiian Airlines Inc." have flights to aside from Pago Pago?, What is the average distance of all flights?, How many cities does the airlines cover?, How many states does the airlines cover?, How many flights were cancelled?, What is the minimum and maximum distance travelled across all flights? Etc.
8.	I uploaded on Power BI. Data was already clean so I went on to visualize.

FINDINGS AND INSIGHTS
From the data analyzed, some insights can be deduced;
1.	There are a total of four airlines in the collated data.
2.	The airlines cover 52 states and 180 cities.
3.	The average distance for all flights were 683.32km.
4.	Delta Air Lines Inc. covered the most distance amongst the airlines and this might be related to them having the maximum number of flights too.
5.	Express Jet Airlines LLC had the maximum number of departure and arrival delay.
6.	Monday had the maximum number of departure/arrival delays while Thursday had the minimum number of arrival/departure delays.
7.	 Monday had the maximum number of flights departure.
RECOMMENDATIONS
    Delta Air Lines Inc. had more departure and arrival delays and this might be as a result of them having the maximum count of flights and this will in turn cause chaos if not planned well .They should plan out their flights to reduce the departure delays which will in turn reduce the arrival delays.
